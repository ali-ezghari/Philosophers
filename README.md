# Philosophers
This project is a simulation of the classic **Dining Philosophers** problem, designed to explore and understand the concepts of threads, mutexes, and concurrent programming in C.

## Objectives

- Implement a solution to the Dining Philosophers problem using **POSIX threads (pthreads)**
- Handle synchronization issues to prevent:
  - Race conditions
  - Deadlocks
  - Starvation
- Use mutexes to protect shared resources (forks)
- Simulate the philosophers' behavior: **thinking**, **eating**, and **sleeping**
